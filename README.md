The Asteroid Radar application is an Android app developed as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program. The app allows users to view information about near-Earth asteroids, including their size, velocity, and distance from Earth.

The app uses the NASA API to fetch data about asteroids, which is then displayed in a user-friendly interface. Users can view a list of all upcoming asteroids, or view details about a specific asteroid. The app also includes a feature to save asteroids to a "favorites" list for easy access.

In addition to displaying asteroid information, the app also includes a feature to display a picture of the day from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day API. Users can also set a reminder to check for upcoming asteroids on a specific date.

Overall, the Asteroid Radar application provides a fun and informative way for users to learn about near-Earth asteroids and stay up-to-date on upcoming asteroid events.
